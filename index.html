			<h1>ü™ê welcome !</h1>
			<p>
				hello ! i am yosyo, yet another french techy weeb gamer nerd musician person :D
			</p>
			<h1>üöÄ tech, computers and code</h1>
			<p>
				i'm a developer, currently studying at the <a href="https://www.42network.org/">42</a> school (proud member of the seekers coalition),
				a really cool school which does not rely on theorical learning and but rather on practical projects.<br>
				<br>
				i've always been really interested by computers and programming. i've started with arduino, that uses a variant of c++.
				later, i started using python for school and i loved it. i'm now learning c for school and soon c++ will come back.<br>
				i want to learn rust to be a blazingly fast cool kid.<br>
				<br>
				i am a big fan of linux, i'm still forced to be on windows because i have too many issues with my nvidia gpu on offload
				but eventualy i'll change my computer for an amd config and then i will be able to daily drive linux again :D<br>
				after trying a lot of distributions, my favorite is by far <a href="https://nixos.org/">nixos</a>, i really love
				the philosophy behind it, and it really often just works except when you do shit but it's almost always your fault.<br>
				<br>
				my main project is to develop and host my own a web-streaming service. i want to try hosting myself everything i can,
				as i find cool to not rely on anything else than myself for certain things.<br>
				to achieve this i need a server, that's where my really cool shiny incredible raspberry pi 5 comes up,
				it's my only server thingy for now but i plan to have a real machine one day dedicated to that.<br>
				<br>
				and of course, as an open-source enthousiast, you can find all of my project's code on my <a href="https://github.com/y-syo">github</a>.
			</p>
			<h1>üé∏ music</h1>
			<p>
				i'm a musician. i can play 3 instruments : a little bit of piano, diatonic accordion and guitar
				(i have 2 guitars, an electric one, a g110 scarlet red cort, and an acoustic one, an alhambra massive z nature).
				i compose music on fl studio since around 2017, i'm still learning and trying to find what i like/want to do in term of genre,
				it's a long but really fun journey.<br>
				i do that for fun and for myself mostly, nothing too serious. i haven't released any good songs yet but i'll update here with a link if i happen to do.
